# Spark. 
## What is Spark?
Spark is a community-based imageboard for authors. It references images (called 'Scenes') from popular art community sites (such as CGSociety) and allows users to add text (called 'Stories') of any size to the Scenes.
Images are not hosted on the site, they are referenced via URLs. Additional information must be provided for adding images to Spark. This serves the purpose of paying proper respect to intellectual property rights of the original authors of the images.
## Why is it on GitHub?
I want the project to flourish. If you have comments, issues or ideas, feel free to add them to Spark.
## How can I use Spark?
Just browse over to [spark.nodester.com](http://spark.nodester.com) and start using the site.
## How can I install it for myself?
Clone the repo. Easy as that. Run npm for the dependencies, run `main.coffee`.
